# UFOs

### Overview of Project: 
This project is an in depth analysis of UFO sightings throughout America. Using JavaScript to build an interactive HTML webpage - users can interact with the webpage by using the Filter Search function to filter through sighting data. 

### Results: 
Navigating through the UFO sightings webpage is simple - users can search for sightings in the Filter Search section (outlined in red in image below). Users can filter using any of the criterias available (Date, City, State, County or Shape). After clicking on the 'Filter Table' button, the table will display all sighting data that meets filtered criteria.

### Summary: 
- Drawback: The 'comments' section in the table cuts off at a certain point. Any longer comments are cut short and you're unable to view full text. 
- Recommendations: 1) To enhance the analysis, sighting data should be gathered from all over the world. Currently, the majority of sightings are only in America. 2) Before filtering the data, it's helpful to have a good understanding of what the data holds (date ranges, cities, etc.) and the only way to do this is to scroll through the data beforehand. It'd be helpful to have a summary of the data so the user knows what to search for.
